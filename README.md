# Pedalboard-Shri
1.  Main Audio Stuff : Record.py - Can record your own voice
2.  SineWaveBasics : main.py - can generate sine wave in mono or stereo
3.  PedalBoard : ScratchVST.py - wraps generated file and extracts a new one


Current Objectives:
A.  Results so far: Can successsfully plot sinewaves through matplotlib, but not any voice or music files just yet
	- Able to load multiple plugins into one file. Need to see if multiple effects from both can be out into one generated sound.
B.  3rd Party Established VSTs need testing
C.  Live Audiostream feature needs to be coded and tested
