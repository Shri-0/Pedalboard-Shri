1.  Main Audio Stuff : Record.py - Can record your own voice
2.  SineWaveBasics : main.py - can generate sine wave in mono or stereo
3.  PedalBoard : Contains Python files with various test secanrios using Pedalboard.


Current Objectives:
A.  Results so far: Can successsfully plot sinewaves through matplotlib, and can process basic voice recordings...need to be able to plot generated music next
	- Able to load multiple plugins into one file. Need to see if multiple effects from both can be out into one generated sound.
B.  3rd Party Established VSTs need testing (not sure if possible with Live Audio at the moment)
C.  Live Audiostream feature needs to be coded and tested - Update: Can route audio out from synth into interface, and can adjust audio as necessary in pedalboard when start button is hit

D. Will need to graphically analyze and plot sounds generated from PedalBoard session folder
